# RightsHub
**Know Your Rights!**

# Inspiration
There are many people in the U.S. that don't know their rights when confronted by the police and the reality of police violence. We wanted to educate and inform the public about their rights through access and display of data from https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/states as well as several resources from ACLU and others. 

# What it does

We built a single web application with routing engaging users to inform them on what to do when there is an altercation with authorities (e.g. policemen) and make the information digestible to the average person. Each marker on our map and each row on the table is not only data but a human life and we try to demonstrate that by linking to articles and stories that describe the situation in which the police violence. The map of police incidents from 2013-2019 shows markers of the victim's biography and what happened at the scene. We also have a data table that shows the list of the victims and allows the user to click on the button to show the counter of black lives lost and the total number of victims from '13-'19.  

# How we built it 
Our designer made prototypes for us to utilize in our app: https://www.figma.com/file/dJp2UQJo0AsZ802cjrUzNR/RightsHub?node-id=0%3A1  
We utilized data from https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/states and filtered out the killings by police in New York. The engagement comes in the form of navigable carousel cards, a quiz, a data visualization of reports, media, and helpful links for the user to explore.
